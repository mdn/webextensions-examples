# selection-to-clipboard

**This add-on injects JavaScript into web pages. The `addons.mozilla.org` domain disallows this operation, so this add-on will not work properly when it's run on pages in the `addons.mozilla.org` domain.**

## What it does

This extension includes:

* a content script, "content-script.js", that is injected into all pages

The content script listens for text selections in the page it's attached to and copies the text to the clipboard on mouse-up.

## What it shows

* how to inject content scripts declaratively using manifest.json
* how to write to the [clipboard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Interact_with_the_clipboard)

## Note
* If the `copySelection` function was in a browser event `clipboardWrite` permissions would be required e.g.
```
"permissions": ["clipboardWrite"]
```
