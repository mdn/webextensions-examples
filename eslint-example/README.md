# ESLint Example

## What it shows

This shows how to configure a WebExtension with
[eslint](http://eslint.org/)
to protect against
writing JavaScript code that may be incompatible with modern versions of
Firefox or Chrome.

## How to use it

This requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](http://npmjs.com/).
