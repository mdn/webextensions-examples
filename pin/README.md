# pin

## What it does

This extension creates a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + Shift + P) to toggle pinning and unpinning of the current tab using the Promise-based WebExtension/BrowserExt API being standardized by the [W3 Browser Extensions][w3-browserext] group.

This is a modified version of Google Chrome's [pin extension example][google-pin-extension] updated to use the [WebExtension browser API Polyfill][browser-polyfill] which means the same code works on both Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.
