Maintained by the [MDN team at Mozilla](https://wiki.mozilla.org/MDN).

WebExtensions are a way to write browser extensions: that is, programs
installed inside a web browser that modify the behaviour of the browser or
of web pages loaded by the browser.

WebExtensions are built on a set of cross-browser APIs: WebExtensions written
for Google Chrome or Opera will in most cases run in Firefox or Edge too.

The "webextensions-examples" repository is a collection of simple but complete
and installable WebExtensions. You can use the examples to see how to use the
WebExtensions APIs, and as a starting point for your own WebExtensions.

The examples are made available under the
[Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/).

## How to use "webextensions-examples"

To use the repository, clone it, install the examples in your favourite
browser (see [installation instructions for Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Packaging_and_installation)),
and see how they work. Each example has its own short README explaining what
it does.

To use these examples in Firefox, you need at least Firefox 45. Some examples
rely on APIs that were added in more recent versions of Firefox.
To check the minimum version of Firefox needed for a given example,
see the `strict_min_version` part of the [applications key](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/applications)
in the example's manifest.json file.
