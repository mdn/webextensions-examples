# proxy-addon

## What it does

This add-on registers a [PAC script](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Proxy_servers_and_tunneling/Proxy_Auto-Configuration_%28PAC%29_file) using the proxy API.

The PAC script is used to load all requests through a proxy server. If no proxy server address or proxy server
port is specified, then the direct (no proxy) internet connection is used to load all requests.

## Authentication

If the proxy server requires authentication (by sending HTTP status code 407), then authentication info is sent to the proxy server. Authentication does not work for SOCKS servers. Note: after the following bugs are fixed, authentication
info can be specified in the FindProxyForURL() function without need of browser.webRequest.onAuthRequired():

To try it out:
* setup a proxy server according to the instructions below
* install the addon or use `web-ext run` (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Getting_started_with_web-ext)
* open options and specify proxy address and port. username/password optional and they do not work with SOCKS proxy servers.
* check your IP address in Firefox. It should be the IP address of the machine on which the proxy server is running.

## What it shows

* How to implement a simple PAC script, and register it using the proxy API.
* How to exchange messages between a PAC script and a background script.
* How to store proxy info using the storage API
* How to authenticate with HTTP and HTTPS/SSL proxy servers (but not SOCKS proxy servers)

## Running a proxy server

In the context of this example, there are 3 types of proxy servers: HTTP, HTTPS/SSL, and SOCKS.

For this example, you should run the proxy server on a machine using a different IP address than the machine on
which this example executes. That way, you can check your public-facing IP address in Firefox to see if your
Firefox connections are being proxied successfully.

If you run this example and the proxy server on the same machine, it will be more difficult to determine if
the example is working.

### Remote machine

Acquire access to a machine with a different public-facing IP address ("remote machine").
This is the host/machine on which the SOCKS or HTTP proxy server will execute. You can use these
examples on localhost, too, but your public-facing IP address won't change when using the proxy server.

### How to run an HTTP proxy server with a username/password

Assuming you have node.js and npm installed on the remote machine,

`npm install -g proxy`

then at the command-line:

`proxy --authenticate 'if \
    [ "$PROXY_AUTH_USERNAME" = "b63GuBL5Mxu6" ] && \
    [ "$PROXY_AUTH_PASSWORD" = "R4ESpG7LsQHe" ]; \
      then exit 0; \
    fi; \
    exit 1;'`

This starts an HTTP proxy server listening on port 3128 with the username b63GuBL5Mxu6 and
password R4ESpG7LsQHe. You can read about this node.js package at
https://github.com/TooTallNate/proxy

To test this proxy server, enter the following into the addon's options:

Proxy server DNS name or IP address: [IP address of machine running proxy server]

Proxy server port: 3128

Proxy server username: b63GuBL5Mxu6

Proxy server password: R4ESpG7LsQHe

Proxy server type: HTTP

### How to run an HTTP proxy server without a username/password

WARNING: DO NOT RUN A PROXY SERVER ON THE PUBLIC INTERNET WITHOUT A STRONG USERNAME/PASSWORD!
These are called open proxy servers and are bad.

Assuming you have node.js and npm installed on the remote machine,

`npm install -g proxy`

then at the command-line:

`proxy`

This starts an HTTP proxy server listening on port 3128 with no username and no password.
You can read about this node.js package at https://github.com/TooTallNate/proxy

To test this proxy server, enter the following into the addon's options:

Proxy server DNS name or IP address: [IP address of machine running proxy server]

Proxy server port: 3128

Proxy server username: [none]

Proxy server password: [none]

Proxy server type: HTTP

### How to run a SOCKS proxy server with a username/password

NOTE: Until https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1360404 is fixed, this addon
won't work with SOCKS proxy servers requiring username/password authentication.

Assuming you have node.js and npm installed on the remote machine:

`npm install -g socksv5`

then at a nodejs command-line:

    var socks = require('socksv5');
    var srv = socks.createServer(function(info, accept, deny) {
      accept();
    });
    srv.listen(1080, 'localhost', function() {
      console.log('SOCKS server listening on port 1080');
    });

    srv.useAuth(socks.auth.UserPassword(function(user, password, cb) {
      cb(user === 'b63GuBL5Mxu6' && password === 'R4ESpG7LsQHe');
    }));

This starts a SOCKS5 proxy server listening on port 1080 with the username b63GuBL5Mxu6 and
password R4ESpG7LsQHe.

Proxy server DNS name or IP address: [IP address of machine running proxy server]

Proxy server port: 1080

Proxy server username: b63GuBL5Mxu6

Proxy server password: R4ESpG7LsQHe

Proxy server type: SOCKS

### How to run a SOCKS proxy server without a username/password

ssh has the ability to run a SOCKS proxy server. From your local machine, execute:

`ssh -D 1080 -f -C -q -N you@123.123.123.123`

where 123.123.123.123 is the IP address of you remote machine. This sets up localhost port 1080 to
tunnel to 123.123.123.123. Since the tunnel is between localhost and the remote machine using ssh,
which is presumably setup for PKI or username/password authentication, no username/password is needed here.
The remote machine is not running an open proxy server on the public internet in this case.

To test this proxy server, enter the following into the addon's options:

Proxy server DNS name or IP address: [IP address of machine running proxy server]

Proxy server port: 1080

Proxy server username: [none]

Proxy server password: [none]

Proxy server type: SOCKS
