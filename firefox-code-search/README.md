# firefox-code-search

## What it does

This extension allows you to search the Firefox codebase using the awesome bar.

To test it out, type 'cs' into the awesome bar followed by a search string (e.g. `cs hello world`). The results will be shown as suggestions, and clicking on a suggestion will navigate to the file where the result was found.

To search a specific file, use the "path:" prefix (e.g. `cs hello path:omnibox.js`)
