# HTTP Response parser

## What it does

Listens to HTTP Responses from example.com and w3.org and changes the body of the response as it comes through. So that the word "Example" on https://example.com becomes "WebExtension Example" and the word "Test" on https://www.w3.org/2006/11/mwbp-tests/ becomes "WebExtension Test".

## What it shows

How to use the response parser on bytes and how to change the response on a non-UTF-8 page without using an encoding library.
