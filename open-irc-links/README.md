# open-irc-links


## What it does

This add-on sets the default client for opening IRC links using `protocol_handlers`.

Whenever a link using the IRC protocol is clicked, the link is opened in the URI defined in the add-on's manifest.
In this example, all IRC protocol links are opened in mibbit.com.  
For example, once you've installed the extension, click this link [irc://irc.freenode.net/drupal](irc://irc.freenode.net/drupal) and the protocol handler opens the Drupal channel in mibbit.com.

## What it shows

How to use protocol handlers to pass content to an application or website designed to handle that content.
